// Now pull in everything from the includes file in
// the base theme, but with changes in any of the variables 
// we have redefined in global/variables.

// We can get includes from the parent theme because we 
// defined it as an includePath in gulp based on 'basetheme'
// in the gulpconfig.js file.
@import includes


// And finally, any more overrides can go here. For example,
// you may want extra partials, etc. for an individual
// child theme.
